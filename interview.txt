Current System Questions: 
1) 
-ID contacted by client 
-Blueprints (less accurate) or physical measurements to achieve intial measurements
-Take all square footage measurements in notebook
	-Insulation and drywall considerated
	-Equipment could chnage under special conditions
	-Variance in drywall grade 
	-Variance in insulation grade (R20 and R40) 
	-Could be specified by either client or drywall guy, must follow regulations and dimensions 
	-Material varies based on location
-Then, all calculations done by same guy back at the office
	-Time frame ballparked by measurement guy
	-One guy (owner) does everything
-Overestimate on purpose at this point, quoted price is price given no matter what
-Sage is used to generate invoices
-Low tech abilities from employees 
-Variation wall to wall potentially
-Sage produces pdf output that's printed

Their Solution: 
-Needs to be verified by owner
-Calculation given range 
-90% for ALL projects 
-Software training is acceptable
-Replacement for sage desirable for all in one soln
-BC government building codes online 
-Commercial and residential restrictions both considered (depending on projects)
-Gabrioila island and ladysmith 
-Manual override and web scraping 
-Price matching
-Company discounts 
-No client measurement 
-Mobile app of use 
-Man hours do vary (effect rate of pay and speed of work)
-Flexibility in employee stats needed due to transiency 

Software-Specific:
-all units imperial (consider converter on all inputs)
-code checking not necessary, but a manually-overridable error indicator is useful
-private only
-proprietary hardware not necessary 
-No maintenance budget
-Pretty colors
-Standard templates for different buildings
